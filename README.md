# Survival
A (unfinished) survival adventure game without zombies.

Made in Unity3D, we were playing around with making a survival game where the focus was actual survival issues like thirst and hunger. Turns out hunger is something you can kind of ignore for weeks if you have to, which makes it not so much of a fun game mechanic unless you exaggerate it.
